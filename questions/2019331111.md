\(Answer all the questions\)

### Group A

1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\).5 × 2 = 10

**\(a\)** What are the mandatory parts in function declaration?  


**Answer:** Return Type Function name Parameters _\(If Any\)_  
 _Example:_   


```text
int sum(int num1, int num2)
```

**\(b\)** Will this part of code work? Explain.   


```text
int a, b, c;
a = b = c = 5; 
```

**Answer:** Yes. This code will work. '=' sign not only assigns the value to the left but also returns the value. Thus a & b will also get the same value assigned.

**\(c\)** What is a storage class? Give some examples of it.

**Example Answer:** Storage class determines the life or scope of symbols such as variable or functions. Example: Auto, Static, Extern etc.

**\(d\)** Assuming a = 5, b = 9, would the following C code block generate any compilation error?   


```text
int a, b, r;
r = a / (b % 3);
printf ("%d", r);
```

**Answer:** The program will be compiled successfully but there will be a runtime error. More specifically a division by zero error.

**\(e\)** What is the preferred syntax for including your own header file in the program? Why?

**Answer:**

```text
#include "myfile.h"
```

If a header file is included with in " ", then the compiler searches for the particular header file first in the current working directory, if not found then in the built in include path.

\(f\) Rewrite the following if else condition using ternary operator.

```text
if (year % 4 == 0) {
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        if (year % 400 == 0) return true;
      return false;
    } 
    return true;
} return false;
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
return year % 4 == 0 ? (year % 100 == 0 ? (year % 400 == 0 ? true : false) : true) : false;
```

**\(g\)** What is being declared in the following statement?

```text
char (*x) (char*);
```

**Answer:** The statement above declares x as a pointer to a function that takes a single character-pointer argument, and returns a character.

**\(h\)** What will happen if we run the following program?

```text
char *_ptr = malloc(1);
_ptr = malloc(1);
free(_ptr);
return 0;
```

**Answer**: The Program will run smoothly but it has memory leak.

2. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Four**\).4 × 5 = 20

**\(a\)** Write a program that will output the cumulative sum of an array using recursion.

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

void cumsum(int *array, int index) {
  if (index <= 0)
    return;
  cumsum(array, index - 1);
  array[index] += array[index - 1];
}

int main(void) {
  int array[] = {1, 2, 3};
  cumsum(array, 2);
  printf("%d %d %d\n", array[0], array[1], array[2]);
  return 0;
}
```

**\(b\)** Below is a program to find if the provided year is leap year or not. Rewrite the program using logical operator and make it more efficient.

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
  int year;
  scanf("%d", &year);
  return year % 4 == 0 ? (year % 100 == 0 ? (year % 400 == 0 ? true : false) : true) : false;
}
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
return year % 4 == 0 && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0);
```

**\(c\)** Create your own data type, a real life object 'car' using struct and assign values or access them. Can we have functionalities inside it?

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

struct car {
  char name[20];
  char color[20];
  int seats;
};

int main() {
  struct car new_car = {"Tesla", "Black", 2};
  return 0;
}
```

No, Struct doesn't support functions. Though we can have functions outside and have a reference inside the struct.

**\(d\)** Write a function to search for an element in a character array using linear search.

**Example Answer:**

```text
int linearSearch(char *c, char letter) { 
  for (int i = 0; c[i] != '\0'; i++) { 
    if (c[i] == letter)
      return i;
  } 
  return -1; 
}
```

**\(e\)** What is doubly linked list? How is it different from singly linked list? Give an example of it.

**Example Answer:** A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields and one data field.

As of differences, singly linked list allows traversal elements only in one way. Doubly linked list allows elements two way traversal.

```text
/* Node of a doubly linked list */
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next; // Pointer to next node in DLL
    struct Node* prev; // Pointer to previous node in DLL
};
```

**\(f\)** Write a program that will take input of the two sides of a rectangle from the command line \(see example below\) and print out the area of it.

```text
./reactangle_area 5 4
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc < 3) printf("Please provide two numbers");
    printf("%d", atoi(argv[1]) * atoi(argv[2]));
} 
```

3. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Two**\).2 × 10 = 20

**\(a\)** Imagine you’re running a travel company that arranges flying tours through the islands. Each tour contains a sequence of short flights from one island to the next. For each of those islands, you will need to record a few pieces of information, such as the name of the island and the hours that its airport is open. Create a program using linked list and provided data that will print the informations sequentially.

```text
Island amity: Time (09:00 - 17:00),
Island craggy = Time (09:00 - 17:00),
Island isla_nublar = Time (09:00 - 17:00), 
Island shutter = Time (09:00 - 17:00)
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct island {
  char *name;
  char *opens;
  char *closes;
  struct island *next;
} island;

void display (island *start) {
  for (island *i = start; i != NULL; i = i->next) {
    printf ("Name: %s Open: %s-%s\n", i->name, i->opens, i->closes);
  }
}

int main() {
  island amity = {"Amity", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
  island craggy = {"Craggy", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
  island isla_nublar = {"Isla Nublar", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};
  island shutter = {"Shutter", "09:00", "17:00", NULL};

  amity.next = &craggy;
  craggy.next = &isla_nublar;
  isla_nublar.next = &shutter;

  display (&amity);
}
```

**\(b\)** You are given an array of n positive integers. For each of them determine whether it has exactly three distinct positive divisors or not.

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long long int n, x, y, r, z;
    scanf("%lld", &n);

    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        r = 0;
        scanf("%lld", &x);
        if (x > 4 && x % 2 == 0 || x == 1) {
            printf ("NO\n");
            continue;
        }
        y = sqrt(x);
        if (y * y == x) {
            z = sqrt(y);
            for (int a = 3; a <= z && r < 1; a = a + 2) {
                if (x % a == 0) {
                    r++;
                }
            }
            if (r == 0 || x == 4)
                printf("YES\n");
            else
                printf("NO\n");
        }
        else
            printf("NO\n");
    }
}
```

**\(c\)** Write a program that will search for a song in a list using the given string.

```text
List of songs:

I left my heart in Harvard Med School,
Newark, Newark - a wonderful town,
Dancing with a Dork,
From here to maternity,
The girl from Iwo Jima,
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char tracks[][80] = {
  "I left my heart in Harvard Med School",
  "Newark, Newark - a wonderful town",
  "Dancing with a Dork",
  "From here to maternity",
  "The girl from Iwo Jima",
};

void find_track(char search_for[]){
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (strstr(tracks[i], search_for))
      printf("Track %i: '%s'\n", i, tracks[i]);
  }
}

int main() {
  char search_for[80];
  printf("Search for: ");
  fgets(search_for, 80, stdin);
  find_track(search_for);
  return 0;
}
```

### Group B

1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\).5 × 2 = 10

**\(a\)** What do you mean by Dangling Pointer Variable in C Programming?

**Answer:** A Pointer in C Programming is used to point the memory location of an existing variable. In case if that particular variable is deleted and the Pointer is still pointing to the same memory location, then that particular pointer variable is called as a Dangling Pointer Variable.

**\(b\)** Differentiate between calloc\(\) and malloc\(\).

**Example Answer:** calloc\(\) and malloc\(\) are memory dynamic memory allocating functions. The only difference between them is that calloc\(\) will load all the assigned memory locations with value 0 but malloc\(\) will not.

**\(c\)** What's the output of this program?

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = -10;

    printf("%d", x - (~y) - 1);
}
```

**Answer:** 0

**\(d\)** Will this program produce any error? If yes, fix it.

```text
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Author Laksh Kishore once wrote "People who come first in class never get good marks in the report card of Life. After all who asks you your CGPA on your last day?"");
    return 0;
}
```

**Answer:** Yes. Need backslash \("\"\) which will ignore the next character.

```text
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Author Laksh Kishore once wrote \"People who come first in class never get good marks in the report card of Life. After all who asks you your CGPA on your last day?\"");
    return 0;
}
```

**\(e\)** What is Dynamic Memory allocation? Mention the syntax.

**Answer:**

```text
ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size);

//deallocation
free(ptr);
```

\(f\) What's the difference between getch\(\) and getche\(\)?

**Answer:** getch\(\): reads characters from the keyboard but it does not use any buffers. Hence, data is not displayed on the screen.

getche\(\): reads characters from the keyboard and it uses a buffer. Hence, data is displayed on the screen.

**\(g\)** Write a C program to print hello world without using a semicolon \(;\).

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include<stdio.h>   

void main() {      
      if(printf("hello world")){} 
}
```

**\(h\)** Write a code to generate random numbers.

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int a,b;
    for(a=1;a<=10;a++) {
          b=rand();
          printf("%d\n",b);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

2. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Four**\).4 × 5 = 20

**\(a\)** Write a code to print the following pattern.

```text
1
12
123
1234
12345
......
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("%d", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

\(b\) This code snippet converts a floating point number to an integer using casting:

```text
float f = 1.0;

int i1 = (int) f;
int i2 = * (int *) &f;

printf("%d\n", i1);
printf("%d\n", i2);
```

The following output is produced:

```text
1
1065353216
```

Can you explain why results differ?

**Example Answer:** The first casting operation properly converts from a floating point number to an integer, as specified by the C standard. The second conversion, however, is first casting a float pointer to an integer pointer which is then dereferenced to get the final result. This way the compiler is effectively treating raw bits from a float \(typically stored in IEEE floating point format\) as if they were bits of an integer. Besides getting a wrong result you are potentially doing a “bad read” operation, in cases where sizeof\(int\) is greater than sizeof\(float\) \(e.g. on some 64-bit architectures\).

Although this particular code is unlikely, it demonstrates one of the risks involved in typecasting when only a pointer to the variable to be cast is available. In practice, the pointer must be dereferenced before it is cast.

**\(c\)** Write a function that will find the length of a string without using the inbuilt function strlen\(\).

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  char String[50];
  int count;
  printf("Enter a string: ");
  scanf("%s", String);

  for(count = 0; String[count] != '\0'; count++);
  printf("The length of string: %d\n", count);
  return 0;
}
```

**\(d\)** Write a program that will swap variables without using any extra variable.

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x, y;

    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

    x = x + y;
    y = x - y;
    x = x - y;

    printf("X: %d\n", x);
    printf("Y: %d\n", y);

    return 0;
}
```

**\(e\)** Is there a way to send a function as a parameter of a function in C? Give an example of it.

**Answer:** Yes. Functions can be sent as pointer.

```text
#include <stdio.h>

void greetMorning();

void greet(void (*greeter)());

int main() {
    greet(greetMorning);

    return 0;
}

void greet(void (*greeter)()) {
    greeter();
}

void greetMorning() {
    printf("Good, morning!\n");
}
```

**\(f\)** Differentiate between call by value and call by reference with examples.

**Example answer:**Call by Value:

```text
#include <stdio.h>

void change(int, int);

int main() {
    int a = 25, b = 50;
    change(a, b);
    printf("The value assigned to a is: %d\n", a);
    printf("n");
    printf("The value assigned to of b is: %d\n", b);
    return 0;
}

void change(int x, int y) {
    x = 100;
    y = 200;
}
```

Call By reference:

```text
#include <stdio.h>

void change(int *, int *);

int main() {
    int a = 25, b = 50;
    change(&a, &b);
    printf("The value assigned to a is: %d\n", a);
    printf("n");
    printf("The value assigned to b is: %d\n", b);
    return 0;
}

void change(int *x, int *y) {
    *x = 100;
    *y = 200;
}
```

3. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Two**\).2 × 10 = 20

**\(a\)** What is Bubble Sort Algorithm? Explain with a program.

**Example Answer:** Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

The following code executes Bubble Sort.

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int array[100], n, i, j, swap;
    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Enter %d Numbers:", n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &array[i]);
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
                swap = array[j];
                array[j] = array[j + 1];
                array[j + 1] = swap;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("Sorted Array:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d\n", array[i]);
    return 0;
}
```

**\(b\)** Nayana wanted to create a design for her cool front page. Given n, print a design that will look like the following:

When n = 5,

```text
          0
        0 1 0
      0 1 2 1 0
    0 1 2 3 2 1 0
  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
  0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 0
    0 1 2 3 2 1 0
      0 1 2 1 0
        0 1 0
          0
```

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{ 
    int n, i, j;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    {
        for (int k = 0; k < (n - i); k++)
            printf("  ");
        for (j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (j == i) {
                printf("%d", j);
                while (j--)
                    printf(" %d", j);
                break;
            }
            else
                printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    i--;

    while (i--)
    {
        for (int k = 0; k < (n - i); k++)
            printf("  ");
        for (j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (j == i) {
                printf("%d", j);
                while (j--)
                    printf(" %d", j);
                break;
            }
            else
                printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

**\(c\)** Write a program that will remove duplicates in an array.

**Example Answer:**

```text
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, a[100], b[100], calc = 0, i, j;
    printf("Enter no. of elements in array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Enter %d integers: ", n);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < calc; j++) {
            if (a[i] == b[j])
                break;
        }
        if (j == calc) {
            b[calc] = a[i];
            calc++;
        }
    }
    printf("Array obtained after removing duplicate elements:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < calc; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", b[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
