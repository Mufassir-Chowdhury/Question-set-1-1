\(a\) _What do you mean by clarity of a program ?_

**Answer :**  
_Clarity is a characteristic of a desirable program. It refers to the overall readability of the program , with particular emphasis on its underlying logic. If a program is clearly written , it should be possible for another programmer to follow the program logic without undue effort . It should also be possible for the original author to follow his or her own program after being away from the program for an extended period of time ._

\(c\) _\(i\) Consider the skeletal of following C program.Here an integer number will be given as input and after compiling the program its factorial will be come as output._

```c
#include<stdio.h>
long long int factorial(int n);
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("n! = %ld\n",factorial(n));
}
long long int factorial(int n)
{
    /*Your code goes here.*/
    /*Sample input*/
    /*10*/
    /*Sample output*/
    /*n! = 3628800*/
}
```

_Now you have to make the **factorial** function using recursion for getting appropriate factorial of given number.So make the **factorial** function and write the C program properly._

_\(ii\) Consider the skeletal of the C program. Here a line of text will be given as input and after compiling the program the same text will come but in reversely._

```c
#include<stdio.h>

}
void reverse(void)
{
    /*Your code goes here.*/
    /*Sample Input:*/
    /*Just think out of the box*/
    /*Sample output:*/
    /*xob eht fo tuo kniht tsuJ*/
}
```

_Now make the **reverse** function using recursion and write the C program properly._

**Answer :**  
_\(i\) After making the **factorial** function , the C program will be :_

```c
#include<stdio.h>
long long int factorial(int n);
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("n! = %ld\n",factorial(n));
}
long long int factorial(int n)
{
    if(n<=1)
        return (1);
    else
        return (n*factorial(n-1));
}
```

_\(ii\) After making the **reverse** function , the C program will be :_

```c
#include<stdio.h>
void reverse (void);
main()
{
    reverse();
}
void reverse(void)
{
    char c;
    if((c=getchar())!='\n')
        reverse();
    putchar(c);
    return;
}
```

 **Group B** 1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\). 5 × 2 = 10

\(a\) _What do you mean by interactive computing ?_

**Answer :**  
_Interactive computing is a type of computing environment that originated with commercial timesharing systems and has been refined by the widespread use of personal computers. In an interactive computing environment , the user and the computer interact with each other during the computational session. Thus , the user may periodically be asked to provide certain information that will determine what subsequent actions are to be taken by the computer and vice versa._

\(b\) _What is not valid floating point constant ?  
2E-8 , 0.006E-3 , 2E110.2 , 3E10_

**Answer :**  
_Invalid floating point constant is : 2E110.2_

\(c\) _How many kinds of programming errors and what are they?_

**Answer :**  
_There are 3 types of programming errors . They are :  
\(1\) Syntactic errors  
\(2\) Runtime or execution errors  
\(3\) Semantic or logical errors_

\(d\) _What is the difference between automatic variables and external variables?_

**Answer :**  
_Automatic variables are always declared within a function and are local to the function in which they are declared; that is , their scope is cconfined to that function. Automatic variables defined in different functions will therefore be independent of one another, even though they may have the same name._  
_On the other hand external variables are not confined to single functions. Their scope extends from the point of definition through the remainder of the program . Hence, they usually span two or more functions , and often an entire program._

\(e\) _Suppose in a C program , there is an array names s is declared as follows:_

```c
char s[80] = "Computer";
```

_Now write the result of the **printf** statement which is written as follows:_

```c
printf("%d %d\n",strlen(s),sizeof(s));
```

**Answer :**  
_The result of the **printf** statement is:_

```c
8 80
```

\(f\) _If an integer type array arr\[8\] is declared as arr\[8\] = { 12, 45, 28} , then which value will be assigned to arr\[2\] and arr\[6\] elements?_

**Answer :**  
_arr\[2\] = 28 and arr\[6\] = 0._

\(g\) _What is the difference between this two character constant \x63 and \143 ?_

**Answer :**  
_According to ASCII Character set , 99 \( in decimal \) is the Ascii value of character c \(lowercase\). And 63 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 99 and 143 is the octal equivalent of 99. So there is a little difference in presentation of the same character. Both of the constant presents character c \(lowercase\)._

\(h\) _What is the permissible range of values of data type unsigned int and ordinary int ?_

**Answer :**  
_The permissble range of values of data type unsigned int and ordinary int is :_

| Data Type | Permissible Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| unsigned int | 0 to 65535 |
| int | -32768 to +32767 |

_There are 5 bugs in the program._  
_The accurate code is :_

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    /*Variable declaration */
    float c,f;
    printf("Enter a value for the temperature in degree (F)  : ");
    scanf("%f",&f);
    /*Formula*/
    c = (5.0 / 9.0) * ( f - 32.0 );
    printf("The corresponding value in the Celcius degree is : %5.1f\n",c);
    return 0;
}
```

\(b\) _Suppose you have many friends\[Maximum 100 friends\]. You know their names and birthdays. But sometimes forget someone’s birthday. Then the friend and the two of you get upset because you can't make a wish.So you have a plan.You will rearrange the birthdays according to calendar order.As a result there will be no risk to forget anyone's birthday._  
_Now write a C program to implement your planning._  
_There are sample input - output for your program._  
_Sample Input:_  
_\(There may several lines where Name day/month/year will be taken and END will finish taking input\)_

```c
