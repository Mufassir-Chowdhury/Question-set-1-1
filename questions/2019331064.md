 \(Answer All the Questions\)  
 **Group A** 1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\). 5 × 2 = 10

\(a\) How to return an array from a function?  
**Example Answer:**  
An array can be returned from a function as a pointer, as an array is a pointer to the its first element.

\(b\) Write a function that takes two parameters **a** and **b** \(**a &lt; b**\) and returns an array of all numbers between **a** and **b** \(inclusive\).  
**Example answer:**  
The following function takes two input **a** and **b** and returns an array of all numbers-

```c
int *retArr(int a, int b) {
    int *arr = (int *) malloc((b-a+1) * sizeof(int));

    for(int i = a; i <= b; ++i) {
        arr[i-a] = i;
    }

    return arr;
}
```

\(c\) Write down the types of error that occur when writing a program. What type of error is `segmentation fault` and why does it occur?  
**Answer:**  
The types of error that occur when writing a program are -  
1\) Compilation error.  
2\) Runtime error.  
3\) Logic error.

`Segmentation fault` is a runtime error, which occurs when a program tries to access an unavailable memory location.

\(d\) What is the output of the following program?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long x = ~0;   // Assume that "long" takes 4 bytes.
    printf("%ld\n", x);
}
```

**Answer:**  
The output of the given program is `-1`.

\(e\) What is the output of the following program?

```c
int main() {
    char* hello = "Hello, world!";
    printf("%8s %.5s\n", hello, hello);
}
```

**Answer:**  
The output is `Hello world! Hello`.

\(f\) What is the difference between & and &&?  
**Answer:**  
& is the bitwise AND operator that performs binary AND operation on two numbers while && is the logical AND operator which returns `true` or `false` depending on whether both sides of the operator returns `true` or `false`.

\(g\) What is the output of the following program?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long long arr[6] = {1, 76, 32, 23, 91, 103};
    long long s = &arr[2];
    long long s2 = &arr[5];

    printf("%lld\n", s2-s);
}
```

**Answer:** The output of the given program is 24.  
\(h\) How are the following variables stored in the memory?

```c
int arr[10];
int *arr2;
arr2 = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
```

**Answer:**  
The varible `int arr[10]` is stored in the stack memory during the compilation. `arr2` is stored in the heap memory allocated manually.

int main() {
    int var = 2;
    int *ptr = &var;
    ++*ptr;
    int **ptr2 = &ptr;
    ++*ptr; ++**ptr2;
    int va = **ptr2++&++*ptr;

    for(int x = 0; x < 3; ++x)
        va *= func();
    va = (va>>10)<<4>>2>>3>>1<<1;
    va = va&va&&va|va;

    printf("%d %010x %X %3.2f\n", va, var<<va, va, va);
}
```

The output of the given code is `0 0000000006 0 0.00`.

\(c\) Write a C program that prints the gcd of the following integers. Use iteration for computing gcd. The function to compute the gcd of the list should take variable number of arguments.  
`100, 70, 30, 50, 10000, 450`  
**Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

#define sz 10000

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while(b != 0) {
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp % b;
    }

    return a;
}

int gcdOfList(int n, ...) {
    va_list numlist;
    va_start(numlist, n);

    int arr[sz];

    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = va_arg(numlist, int);
    }

    va_end(numlist);

    int g = arr[0];

    for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        g = gcd(g, arr[i]);
    }

    return g;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", gcdOfList(6, 100, 70, 30, 50, 10000, 450));
}
```

\(d\) What is **memory leak**? Why does it happen? How to fix it?  
**Example Answer:**  
**Memory leak** is a condition where a program cannot reuse the memory not in use any more due to it being not free, resulting in the accumulation of extra memory to function, ultimately causing the program to be resource hungry and slowing it down.  
When a program is compiled, the local variables and function calls are placed in the stack memory. The stack memory allocates and deallocates space automatically. On the other hand, in **dynamic memory management**, which is done at run time instead of compile time, the space allocated into the heap memory. Unlike stack, heap memory is not managed automatically. It has to be used and freed through explicit command. When a memory in heap is not in use anymore but left unfreed, the program aquires new memory to store manually allocated variables instead of reusing that same memory. Over the course, such unused unfreed memories accumulate a large amount of memory, affecting the performance.  
Memory leak can be fixed by releasing the memory immediately after it is no longer of use.

 3. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Two**\). 2 × 10 = 20

\(a\) Explain how the following code snippet work? What is the time complexity and space complexity of the following functions?

```c
struct node {
    long v;
    struct node *next, *tail;
};

typedef struct node node;

node **createArr(long n) {
    node **arr = (node **) malloc(n * sizeof(node *));

    for(long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = NULL;
    }

    return arr;
}

void push_back(node **head, long v) {
    node *temp = (node *) malloc(sizeof(node));
    temp->v = v;
    temp->next = NULL;
    temp->tail = NULL;

    if((*head) == NULL) {
        *head = temp;
        return;
    }

    if((*head)->next == NULL) {
        (*head)->next = temp;
        (*head)->tail = temp;
        return;
    }

    (*head)->tail->next = temp;
    (*head)->tail = temp;
}
```

**Answer:**  
The code snippet work by first defining a `struct` named `node` which contains a member `val` and a pointer to the next node. It is a linked list structure. It defines a user defined type called `struct node`. In order to shorten the name, a type alias is defined where the alias of the type name is `node`, that is, simply typing `node` will actually refer to `struct node` type. Then there are two functions `**createArr` and `push_back` which creates an array of linked list and inserts a new node at the end of a linked list respectively.  
The `**createArr` functions takes a parameter `n` and works by first defining a double pointer to a node `arr` and then dynamically allocating the space for `n` linked list in the heap memory. In this case `**arr` is a pointer to the first linked list. Then it assign all linked list with pointing to NULL pointer by default and returns the array `arr`.  
The `push_back` function takes two parameter, a pointer to the node `head` which is a reference to the first node of a linked list, and a `long int` v, which is the value to be pushed back. It first creates a new node, then checks if the head is NULL \(that is, its an empty linked list\). If so, it assigns the new node to `head`. If not, it assigns it at the end of the list by inserting it at the end of the `tail`, which holds the address of the last element.  
For an array of linked list with `n` linked lists, the time and space complexity of the `**createArr` method/function is O\(n\) & O\(n\) respectively. For a linked list, the time and space complexity for `push_back` function is O\(1\) & O\(1\) respectively.

\(b\) Explain the differences between **linked list** and **array**. Define a **linked list** with a function `insert()` to insert data at the end of the list **in constant time**.  
**Example Answer:**  
While **linked list** and **array** are two mechanism to store a list of objects, they are different because they store objects in different manner. **Linked list** is a chain of nodes, each of them storing a data and a reference/pointer to the next node. Nodes in linked list are stored in the heap memory and are dynamically allocated during runtime. They are not necessarily stored in contiguous memory locations. All the data and references to the next node forms a chain of nodes in the memory. Due to being not stored in contiguous memory, each element can't be retrieved by simply refering to it through index. One has to traverse through the linked list to find a node and process it, making it a slower process than array. However, it doesn't have fixed size, making it easier to insert and delete datas without worrying about how much data to store.  
On the other hand, **array** is a contiguous memory block that is stored in the stack memory. Array has fixed size. Its size is known at the compile time and thus, cannot be enlarged or shrunk during run time. This property makes it harder to use when it's not known how much data have to be stored during runtime. However, its use of contiguous memory makes it easier to extract a data using index. Traversing through the elements is also faster on array.  
Here goes a **linked list** definition with an `insert()` function to insert data at the end in constant time -

```c
struct node {
    long v;    // int, long long etc. types can also be inserted based on situation....
    struct node *next, *tail;
};

typedef struct node node;

void insert(node **arg, long v) {
    node *temp = (node *) malloc(sizeof(node));
    temp->v = v;
    temp->next = NULL;
    temp->tail = NULL;

    if((*arg) == NULL) {
        *arg = temp;
        return;
    }

    if((*arg)->next == NULL) {
        (*arg)->next = temp;
        (*arg)->tail = temp;
        return;
    }

    (*arg)->tail->next = temp;
    (*arg)->tail = temp;
}
```

\(c\) A file `data.txt` contains a list of **n** intergers **a1,a2,a3,......,an** separated by comma. Write a C program to rewrite the file with the increasingly sorted list of the integers **s1,s2,s3,.......,sn** separated by comma, as it was. \[Hint: Use bubble sort to sort.\]  
**Example Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define sz 1000000

void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int size) {
    while(1) {
        int flag = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i+1 < size; ++i) {
            if(arr[i] > arr[i+1]) {
                swap(&arr[i], &arr[i+1]);
                flag = 1;
            }
        }

        if(!flag) {
            break;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[sz], size = 0;
    FILE* myfile = fopen("data.txt", "r");  // r+ can also be used...

    while(fscanf(myfile, "%d,", &arr[size]) != EOF) {
        ++size;
    }

    bubbleSort(arr, size);
    freopen("data.txt", "w", myfile);
    fprintf(myfile, "%d", arr[0]);   // Printing the first element for convenience.....

    for(int i = 1; i < size; ++i) {
        fprintf(myfile, ",%d", arr[i]);  // This way, there is no comma after the last element...
    }

    fclose(myfile);
}
```

 **Group B** 1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\). 5 × 2 = 10

\(a\) What will the following expressions yield?

```c
int arr[10] = {43, 23, 53, 53, 64, 09, 455, 32, 32, 12};

for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

**Answer:**  
The given expressions will yield compilation error because the array contains an invalid octal literal `09`.

\(b\) What is the difference between = and ==?  
**Answer:**  
= is the assignment operator which is used to assign values to variables while == is the equality operator which compares the values on two sides and return `true` or `false`.

\(c\) What is pointer arithmatic? Explain in short.  
**Answer:**  
Pointer arithmatic is doing arithmatic operation with pointer variables. Since pointer is an address, which is a numeric value, arithmatic operations can be performed on pointer variable, although they are somewhat different than normal arithmatic.

\(d\) What does freopen\(\) do? What is the difference between fopen\(\) and freopen\(\)?  
**Answer:**  
freopen\(\) reuses an existing stream to access a different file or access the same file with a different mode. fopen\(\) opens a file to a filestream \(_FILE\*_ object\), while freopen\(\) reuses an existing filestream.

\(e\) What is the difference between the modes **r+** and **w+** for when opening a file in C?  
**Answer:**  
The difference between the modes **r+** and **w+** is that while both of the modes can read and write to a file, **r+** mode starts to read the file from the start and shows error when the file doesn't exists whereas **w+** mode erases all the previous elements in the file and creates a new file in case the file doesn't exist.

\(f\) What is the key difference between **struct** and **union**? Give an example.  
**Answer:**  
The key difference between **struct** and **union** is that **struct** allocates memory for all of its elements and making them usable separately whereas **union** allocates memory for its largest element and only one element is usable at a time.

\(g\) What are **primitive data types**? What are the integer data types in C?  
**Answer:**  
**Primitive data types** are built-in types in C that serve as the building block of a C program. The integer data types are -  
1\) int. 2\) unsigned int. 3\) long int. 4\) unsigned long int. 5\) long long int. 6\) unsigned long long int. 7\) char. 8\) unsigned char.

\(h\) Is the following code correct ? If not, write the correct code and write the output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define ptr int*

int main() {
    ptr p1 = 2;
    printf("%d\n", p1);
}
```

**Answer:**  
The code is incorrect. The correct code is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define ptr int*

int main() {
    ptr p1 = (int *)2;
    printf("%d\n", p1);
}
```

The output is `2`.

 2. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Four**\). 4 × 5 = 20

\(a\) Write a program that takes an integer **n \(n &lt;= 64\)**, followed by n integers and prints every possible subsets of the integers. Print **E** for empty subset.  
**Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define sz 100

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    long long arr[sz];

    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    long long bm = (1 << n) - 1;

    for(long long i = 0; i <= bm; ++i) {
        int flag = 0;

        for(int b = 0; b < n; ++b) {
            if(i & (1 << b)) {
                printf("%d ", arr[b]);
                flag = 1;
            }
        }

        if(flag == 0) {
            printf("E");
        }

        puts("");
    }
}
```

\(b\) What are **recursion** and **iteration**? Explain the differences between of them and their respective advantages and disadvantages.  
**Example Answer:**  
**Recursion** is the mechanism of a function calling itself. It is a mechanism to repeatedly do a single task unless the base condition is met. **Iteration** is the process of doing a repeatitive task by enclosing them in a loop which is then repeatedly executed unless a particular condition is met.  
While recursion and iteration are both used to do repeatitive tasks, they have some fundamental differences and therefore, both of them has their usage based on situtation. In case of recursion, when a function calls itself to do a task, it allocates memory in the stack and push the new instance of the task into it. It goes on until the base condition is met. Then the function stops allocating new memory in the stack. In case of iteration, this doesn't happen. Only the memory necessary to store the variables are created once and reused over the course. Therefore, iteration has better memory efficiency.  
Due to the constant pushing and maintaining of the function calls into the stack, recursion is somewhat slower than iteration as iteration doesn't have to do this.  
Recursive codes often need less code to be written and the codes are more readable and clear, whereas iterative codes are slightly complex, longer and sometimes, unreadable.

\(c\) Write a program that prints the following array **using only pointer.**  
`int var[10] = {59, 43, 24, 53, 23, 567, 53, 104, 642, 923};`  
**Example Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int var[10] = {59, 43, 24, 53, 23, 567, 53, 104, 642, 923};
    int *ptr = var;

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", *ptr);
        ++ptr;
    }

    puts("");
}
```

\(d\) Write a program that prints the following pattern. Come up with a formula instead of just printing them.

```text
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 
1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 1 
1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 1

1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Example Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for(int i = 1; i <= 6; ++i) {
        for(int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
            printf("%d ", (i < j ? i: j));
        }

        for(int j = 6; j >= 1; --j) {
            printf("%d ", (i < j ? i: j));
        }

        puts("");
    }

    for(int i = 6; i >= 1; --i) {
        for(int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
            printf("%d ", (i < j ? i: j));
        }

        for(int j = 6; j >= 1; --j) {
            printf("%d ", (i < j ? i: j));
        }

        puts("");
    }
}
```

 3. Answer the following Questions. \(Any **Two**\). 2 × 10 = 20

\(a\) What is `tower of hanoi`? Write a C program to recursively print the moves of 3 disks into the rods A, B and C to transfer all of them from disk A to disk B. Compute the time complexity.  
**Answer:**  
`Tower of hanoi` is a mathematical game consiting of 3 rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The disks are slid into the rods. The game starts with all the disks at one rod and then the disks are moved to various rods unless all the disks are transferred to another rod. It has some rules: 1\) Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
2\) No larger disk can be placed at the top of a smaller one. The C program is written below -

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void tower_of_hanoi(int n, char src, char target, char aux) {
    if(n > 0) {
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, src, aux, target);
        printf("%c to %c\n", src, target);
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, aux, target, src);
    }
}

int main() {
    tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'B', 'C');
}
```

The complexity of tower of hanoi for n disks is 2n-1.

\(b\) Implement a linked list along with the functions `push_back()` to insert element at the back and `display()` to display all the elements inside it. The `push_back()` function should have time complexity of O\(1\).  
**Answer:**

```c
struct node {
    long v;
    struct node *next, *tail;
};

typedef struct node node;

void push_back(node **arg, long v) {
    node *temp = (node *) malloc(sizeof(node));
    temp->v = v;
    temp->next = NULL;
    temp->tail = NULL;

    if((*arg) == NULL) {
        *arg = temp;
        return;
    }

    if((*arg)->next == NULL) {
        (*arg)->next = temp;
        (*arg)->tail = temp;
        return;
    }

    (*arg)->tail->next = temp;
    (*arg)->tail = temp;
}

void display(node *start) {
    while(start != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", start->val);
        start = start->next;
    }

    puts("");
}
```

\(c\) Write a program that takes variable number of students' name \(only the first name\), ID and the percentage they obtained in the final exam and store them in a file `students.in` in **decreasing order** of their percentage. The program may be run in several sessions, each session consisting of inputting variable number of students' informations. After each session, the file should be updated in a sorted manner. If the percentages of two students are same, sort them in **increasing order** of their ID.  
**Example Answer:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

* [x] I am declaring that, the above work is my own work. Whatever added above

  except the template is the result of my brainstorming. I also understand that

  submitting work that isn’t my own may result in permanent failure of this course

  as well as the whole current semester.
