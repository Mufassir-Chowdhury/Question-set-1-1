 \(Answer All the Questions\)  
 **Group A** 1. Answer the following Questions in short. \(Any **Five**\). 5 × 2 = 10

\(a\) What is the conversion rule if two operands are long int and unsigned int?  
**Answer/Example Answer:**  
 If one of the operands is long int and other is unsigned int, then:,  
 i. If unsigned int can be converted to long int, the unsigned int operator will be converted as such the result will be long int.  
 ii. Otherwise, both operands will be converted to unsigned long int and the result will be unsigned long int.

\(b\) What is the difference between scanf and getchar?  
 **Answer/Example Answer:**  
 The main difference between scanf and getchar is that scanf function helps to read input from the keyboard and to store them according to the given format specifier while getchar reads a single character from the keyboard.

\(c\) Write down a program to return a string "sustcse" from a c function?  
 **Answer/Example Answer:**  


```text

#include <stdio.h>

const char* func () {
    char *ara = "sustcse";
    return ara;
}

int main()
{
    printf ("%s", func ());
    return 0;
}
```

\(d\) What is primary memory? Why is it needed in CPU?  
 **Answer/Example Answer:**  
 Primary memory is a semiconductor memory and it is needed for all kinds of processing in CPU. In fact, CPU cannot work directly on the other memory. Whatever data/program is needed bt the CPU, it must be present in the primary memory.  


\(e\) How to set m bytes of array ara1 to the character ch using library function?  
 **Answer/Example Answer:**  
 _memset \(ara1, ch, m\);_

\(f\) Explain this declaration   
int \(_p \(char a\)\) \[10\];_  
 _\*Answer/Example Answer:_  
 p is a function that accepts an argument which is a pointer to a character and returns a pointer to a 10-element integer array.  


\(g\) Consider the following statement  
 int _ptr = &a;_  
_ptr = &a;_  
_Why isn't in the assignment statement, p is preceded by_  symbol?  
 **Answer/Example Answer:**  
 _At the time of declaration,_  symbol is not acting as an indirection operator.  _symbol in the first statement tells the compiler that p is a pointer to an integer. But, if we write_ p = &a then it is wrong, because here  _symbol indicates the indirection operator and we cannot assign the address to some integer variable. Therefore, in the assignment statement there is no need of_  symbol in front of ptr.\*

\(h\) What would be the output of the following piece of code?  
 int n = 40; printf \("%d", !\(\(~\(n == 40\)  _-1\) &gt;&gt; 1\)\);_   
 _\*Answer/Example Answer:_  
 0.
